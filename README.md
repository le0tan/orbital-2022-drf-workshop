# Orbital 2022 Workshop: Django and Django REST Framework

This workshop covers the basics of backend development using Django and Django Rest Framework. We will start from scratch and build the REST API for a self-serving order system similar to McDonaldâ€™s. You will learn about Django data models (aka `django.db.models`), the Django admin panel, token-based authentication and basic-to-intermediate Django Rest Framework usage.
